# Optimal-Product-Weight-Model-for-Supply-Chain-Management
This repository aims to build a model, using historical data that will determine the optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time to the warehouse. Also, to analyze the demand pattern in different pockets of the country so management can drive the advertisement campaign, particularly in those pockets.
